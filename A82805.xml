            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>F His Majeſty had not given up all the Faculties of His Soule to an earneſt endeavour of a Peace and Reconciliation with His People, Or if He would ſuffer Himſelfe by any provocation to be drawne to a ſharpneſſe of Language, at a time when there ſeems ſomewhat like an Overture of Accommodation, He could not but reſent the heavy charges upon Him in the Preamble of theſe Propoſitions, and would not ſuffer Himſelfe to be reproached with protecting of Delinquents by force from Juſtice (His Majeſties deſire having al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes been, That all Men ſhould be tryed by the known Law, and having been refuſed it) with rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing an Army againſt His Parliament: And to be told, That Arms have been taken up againſt Him for the defence of Religion, Laws, Liberties, Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges of Parliament; And for the ſitting of
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:172041:7"/>
the Parliament in ſafety, with many other particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars in that Preamble, ſo often and ſo fully anſwered by His Majeſty without remembring the world of the time, and circumſtances of raiſing thoſe Arms againſt Him; When His Majeſty was ſo farr from being in a condition to invade other mens Rights, that He was not able to maintaine and defend His own from violence. And without telling His good Subjects, That their Religion (the true Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Religion in which His Majeſty was born, hath faithfully lived, and to which He will dye a willing Sacrifice) their Laws, Liberties, Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges, and ſafety of Parliament, were ſo amply ſettled and eſtabliſhed, or offered to be ſo by His Majeſtie, before any Army was raiſed againſt Him, and long before any raiſed by Him for His defence, That if nothing had been directed, but that Peace and Protection which His Subjects, and their Ancectors had in the beſt times enjoyed under His Majeſty, or His Royall Predeceſſors, this miſunderſtanding and diſtance between His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty and His People; and this generall miſery and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraction upon the Face of the whole Kingdom had not been now the Diſcourſe of Chriſtendom; But His Majeſty will forbear any expreſſions of bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, or of a ſenſe of His own ſufferings, That if it be poſſible the memory thereof may be loſt to the World; And therefore though many of the Propoſitions preſented to His Majeſty by both Houſes appear to Him very derogatory from, and deſtructive to His Juſt Power and Prerogative, and
